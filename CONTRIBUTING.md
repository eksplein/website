# Contributing

Welcome to the contributing guide ! :wave:

The following document will explain how to set up a proper workspace and start contributing on the Eksplein client.

## Install

The main requirement is to install **Node**. You are free to choose between using `npm` or `yarn` as your package manager.

```bash
node -v   # Check Node version
npm -v    # Check npm version
```

You can install [**Gravit Designer**](https://www.designer.io/), a free full-featured cross-platform vector graphic design application, if you plan to contribute to the mockup file `project.gvdesign`.

It is recommended to use a decent **Markdown** editor, like **Typora**, if you plan to contribute to the blog posts.

Install dependencies using your Node package manager.

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Now, you should be able to launch a dev server, using the following command.

```bash
npm run dev
```
